# PatternQ Vesicles (Demo)

Demo version of **PatternQ** trained on predicting average vesicle sizes from synthetic fluorescence images.

This is just the minimal code and container setup needed to demonstrate the CLI.

## Notes
- Images used here are **synthetic** (for demonstration only).
- This repo serves as a **minimal working example**.
- For full PatternQ functionality, see the main project (coming soon).
